# GPT Pipes

GPT Pipes is a program designed to automate complex tasks through natural language processing with ChatGPT. It enables you to define task templates with natural language instructions and chain these templates into pipelines. When executed, each pipeline uses the output of one task as the input for the next, allowing for multi-step operations. This facilitates efficient task management and workflow automation using ChatGPT.

One of the key advantages of using GPT Pipes over a standalone ChatGPT system lies in the **automation of multi-step processes**. In a traditional interaction with ChatGPT, users would need to manually feed in new inputs after each response, slowing down the completion of complex tasks. GPT Pipes automates this process, allowing for a more efficient path to the final response. Furthermore, GPT Pipes **filters out irrelevant information from previous tasks**, thereby enabling the chatbot to focus solely on the current task at hand. This refines the output quality and reduces the risk of errors. Additionally, GPT Pipes can be configured to obfuscate that an input was generated by ChatGPT, **enhancing the system's reliability and objectivity when evaluating and correcting its own responses**.
